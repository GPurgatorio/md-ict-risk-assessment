# ICT Risk Assessment

The exam can be done in 3 ways: the testing of a practical tool (for security), a presentation on a paper (about security and risk assessment) or an usual exam (don't choose this one :D).

- **ICT-free-faculty-tools.pdf** PDF listing some free and possible tools usable for the final project.
- **ICTRA lessons resume.pdf** It's a VERY MINIMAL resume of the whole program made by myself, so there may be some mistakes and it's definitely not covering the whole variety of the thousands of course's slides! Just something to start or repeat on.
- **Presentation.pptx** It's the final presentation for the course. Everything that is needed to understand (cited paper, references, etc) are in the notes. Furthermore, notes contain also a description of what the slides mean (note that **bold words** implies a step ahead in the animations!)
